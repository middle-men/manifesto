The same way Switzerland keeps everybody's money, we strive to be internet's neutral ground.

The idea is to contextualise web pages that are currently seen by a user.

Users will be able to form broader communities around websites, topics, videos and all other content present on the web.

Our key goal is to get them to interact in a space moderated by unbiased people. Sure, we're not completely unbiased, we're still people just like you, but we're not owners of a given website, video or whatever content you'll be surfing.

There will be no biased moderation, though some moderation will be required. We're strong believers of free speech, so anything that falls out of this category will be banned.

In this way, we give a neutral ground for people to interact with each other. We hope to raise the bar and reward the lonesome cowboy that posted a very nuanced, fact-based response to that YouTube video.
